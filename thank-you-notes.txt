Dear Srini,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for the opportunity to interview. I appreciate the time and consideration you and the team invested in the interview process. I am even more excited about the opportunity to potentially join Sun life and help drive its continued success. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you need any additional information from my end.

Once again, thank you for considering me for this role. I look forward to the possibility of becoming a part of the Sun Life family.

Sincerely,

Touhidul Islam
