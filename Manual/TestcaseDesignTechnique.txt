Test case Design Techniques:
----------------------------
a) Error Guessing
b) Boundary Value Analysis
c) Decision Table Techniques
d) State Transaction Techniques
e) Equvalence Partioning

Brief discussions:
-------------------
a) Error Guessing > analytical thinking of individual test engineers. all people are not thinking about the same way. 
  Example: you are testing numeric digit field.
  1) positive thinking test data: 12345679
  2) negative thinking test data: (is the main area to find the defects you need to focus on)
    test data might be:
                    - fraction number > 100.50
                    - alphanumeric > abc123
                    - special chars >  !@#$
                    - uppercase or lower case chars > ABC or abc
                    - Blank or empty
                    - space char( before or after number)
   ultimately tester will drive the more scenarios to find of guess the error. this is all about the Error Guessing.
